The Multiple Disease Prediction project is a web application built using Streamlit, designed to predict the likelihood of three major diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. The primary goal of this project is to integrate both the front-end and back-end on a single platform, offering users a smooth and interactive experience. Users can input relevant medical data, such as age, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more, to assess their risk of developing these diseases.

This project leverages machine learning models trained on relevant datasets for each condition. These models analyze the input data and provide a prediction of whether the user is at risk. The backend handles the computations and predictive logic, while Streamlitâ€™s easy-to-use interface ensures seamless interaction for the user.

For diabetes prediction, factors like glucose levels, BMI, and age are considered. Heart disease predictions are based on parameters like cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more. For Parkinson's Disease, vocal measurements and other features are used to assess the likelihood of the condition.

Streamlit makes the app accessible without requiring complex setups, enabling even non-technical users to make informed predictions. This application can be particularly useful in preventative healthcare, assisting users in early disease detection and encouraging timely medical consultation. The combination of a user-friendly interface and accurate predictive models ensures a comprehensive tool for assessing multiple health risks from one platform.
